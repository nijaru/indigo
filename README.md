# Sub
Sub is an interpreter written in Go.
It is based off of the Monkey language from the book *Writing an Interpreter in Go* by Thorsten Ball.

## Goals
It will start as an implementation of the Monkey interpreter as per the book, and I will be developing it more from there. The priority is to learn more about interpreters and compilers, but I may work on the project further.

## Features
- C-like syntax
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- first-class and higher-order functions
- closures
- a string data structure
- an array data structure
- a hash data structure
